## Summary

*Pokémon Gold & Silver* as the first Pokémon games I have ever played, they brought me some tremendous good memories. I still remember the time when I booted up my Gameboy Advance SP right after finishing my homework, in order to start this unforgotten adventure.

However, due to the translation quality of the ROMs at that time, they hardly gave any proper experience to the Chinese players back then. It is hard to explain to western gamers but overall the translation was completely unrelated to the game whatsoever. A famous translation for *Dragonite used Hyper Beam* is translated as *Fat Big used Decoration Punch*. And yeah, that's the reason for me to start a new translation project completely from the strach to correct everyting.

Due to some technical limiation of the Gameboy itself, it is really hard to make a Chinese ROM translation for a long time, until I finally noticed the Korean version of Pokémon during the Nintendo Direct for Pokémon Sun & Moon in 2016.

The Korean versions of Pokémon Gold & Silver have technical advantages to make them into Chinese translated ROMs. But nobody has ever done this because I guess there are few people who both know Korean and Pokémon Games. So that's why I tried to complete this. Actually I had this idea a few years ago but at that time I have to figure out how to export Korean text and I did not have much time back then. But now, I finally figured out many stuff for making this project a reality.


## How to Use the Patch
- Go to the Release Section to Download Patch. There are patches for the original Korean ROMs or the English ROMs. Notice that no matter which one you choose, the final ROMs are always based on the Korean Versions.

- Use a third-party ROM patch tool such as MultiPatch to patch the original ROM.

## About this semi-Chinese Version
- This version will become the first one to be here with a long time, unless there are some really serious frezzing glitches in the games. But I will still collecting feedback for future refinements.
- How to know you have the latest version from version 093: You will see *v094* in the in-game settings.

## What is Translated

- Almost all the text, system text, battle text, event text, PokéDex text, etc..
- Uncompressed images, including images in pack system,trainer system,etc..
- Most of the compressed images, including the title screen, maps, PokéDex system, jigsaw puzzles, radio system,etc..


## What have been changed from v0.93

### Glitches that can freeze the game or make the story unplayable
- Fixed a glitch freezing the game after the in-game characters using *Thunderbolt* during a battle
- Fixed a glitch freezing the game after using a *Rare Candy* to a Pokémon
- Fixed a glitch freezing the game after listeing the radio when *Team Rocket* controlled the Goldenrod Tower
- Fixed a glitch which stops player from finishing the task of delivering a mail to an in-game character

### Display Glitches
- Fixed the incorrect text for the Ground type.
- Fixed the wrong nickname and OT name for Shuckle received in Cianwood City in Pokemon Silver.
- Fixed the untranslated trainer name for the fishing house in Lake of Rage.
- Fixed the untranslated item name for coins in Celadon Game Corner.
- Fixed the untranslated *어디로 이동하겠습니까?* （where would you like to move?) when swapping a move in the moves view.
- Fixed the untranslated trainer names unused in the game. These names may appear in the radio.
- Fixed incorrect display for the radio show *Pokédex Show*.
- Fixed some other minor display glitches and inappropriate control characters.


### Translation Related
- Updating the terminologies from the latest Pokémon games such as PokéGear.
- Fixing the mistrastion for Union Cave as Seaward Cave in the previous version. 
- Updating texts in the battle system to follow the latest Chinese versions of Pokémon games.
- Updating texts in the radio system.
- Changing translation for berries only in Gen II Pokemon games.
- Adding punctuation to the text whenever possible.



### New Features
- Now Pokédex can sort Pokémons with Chinese Pinyin order instead of Korean Hangul order.


### Fixes for Displaying Longer Text Due to Insufficient ROM Space
- Github username monkey7581sss888 provided some fixes for displaying longer text in the game for some cases. Thanks for the help buddy.

### Others
- The titlescreen image has been changed to be a little bit bigger.
- The code for these characters in v0.93 has been assigned to different characters.
	- 「舟」-> 「瑕」 
	- 「企」-> 「绚」 
	- 「众」-> 「栋」 
	- 「伞」-> 「枚」 
	- 「肋」-> 「煌」
	- 「旬」-> 「署」
	- 「旭」-> 「肥」
	
## Chinese Input Method and Clock Resetting
- Too bad I have no idea about how to program a Chinese input method into the game. However, because Hangul has some special properties, I can provide a web page for anyone who wanted to type Chinese characters into the game.


## Some Fixes for the Original Games
- Fixed the wrong animation speed for the HP bar above 48HP.
- Fixed a glitch where Fast Balls, Love Balls, and Moon Balls have incorrect catch rate over some Pokémons.
- Fixed a glitch where the catch rate is not affected after a Pokémon being paralyzed, poisoned, or burned.
- Fixed a glitch where the text of HOF is not updated after 200 beats in Pokémon League.


## Something that is not a glitch of this Translation
- You cannot encounter wild Pokémons using the move Rock Smash in Burned Tower.

## Something that is not on the todo list
- An in-game Chinese input method
- The partially broken title image in the Mystery Gifts
- Some charaters will still be in horizontal ones due to the size limitation
- Extra space after some trainer names and etc..
